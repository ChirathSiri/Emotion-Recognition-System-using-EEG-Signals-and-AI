Emotion Recognition System using EEG Signals and AI

EMOTION X DATA RESEARCH PROJECT
In this system, I have implemented an Al User-Friendly Emotion Recognition System called Emotion X. Aim for this project is to provide a user-friendly and accurate emotion recognition system to the users. During the implementations, this system used EEG brain signals to identify human emotions accurately.

Configurations:
1. DEAP datasets
2. Preprocessed methods like downsampling, low-pass filter, etc
3. Bandpower and spectral density were used for feature extractions in the DEAP system
4. Arousal, valence, and James Russell's model for emotion recognition in the DEAP system
5. SVM, Random Forest, and KNN methods for classification and emotion recognition in DEAP system

Libraries:

1. Matplotlib
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Scikit-learn
5. Seaborn
6. SciPy

Used Technologies: Machine Learning, PHP, Python, MYSQL, HTML, JS, CSS, GitHub
